# Football Player Market Value Prediction – Machine Learning System

This project was developed as part of my Master's degree in Computer Science.

It presents a complete machine learning system designed to predict the market value of professional football players using real-world performance data.

## Project Overview

This project implements and compares multiple machine learning models to evaluate their performance in predicting football players' market value.

The system includes:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Training and evaluation of multiple ML models
- Model comparison using RMSE
- Interactive prediction interface using Streamlit

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- CatBoost
- Streamlit

## Models Implemented

- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- CatBoost
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Gradient Boosting

## Key Features

- Comparative study of multiple models
- Complete ML pipeline implementation
- Real-world dataset analysis
- Interactive prediction system
